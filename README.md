Our task is to develop a supply-demand equation tailored for Dosttâ€™s two sided marketplace. 
This equation will help determine the optimal number of Superdosts required to meet the needs of our users. 
By assuming relevant metrics and using mock data, we aim to ensure a balanced and efficient interaction between users and Superdosts.
